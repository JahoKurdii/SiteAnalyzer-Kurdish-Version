# Kurdish URL Info Tool (PHP)

A PHP script that allows Kurdish users to fetch and inspect website information by entering a URL and HTTP method (GET or POST). It retrieves the websiteâ€™s headers, body, HTTP status code, and resolves the IP address, then shows location and ISP details using the ip-api.com service.

## Features

- Supports GET and POST requests
- Shows full response headers and body
- Displays HTTP status code
- Resolves hostname to IP address
- Fetches IP location, ISP, and other metadata from ip-api.com
- Error messages and prompts shown in Kurdish for local users


## Requirements

- PHP with cURL enabled
- Internet access for fetching IP data from ip-api.com

## Notes

- SSL verification is disabled for development (can be enabled for production).
- For smoother experience without page reload, AJAX integration can be added.

## License

This project is open-source and free to use.
